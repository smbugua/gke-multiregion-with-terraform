# Sandbox GCP Terraform

This project involves the creation and management of a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure for GKE sandbox using Terraform. The following are the key components and steps involved in this project:

## 1. Network and Zones
- Define and create the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network in the us-central1 and us-east1 regions.
- Specify and create three availability zones in each region.

## 2. Security and Access Control
- Define Cloud Firewall rules for controlling access to resources.
- Configure Cloud Armor and WAF settings for DDoS defence and web application security.
- Create Firewall rules for communication between the GKE cluster and Apigee proxies.

## 3. Service Mesh and Event Processing
- Develop Terraform scripts for creating GKE clusters with Anthos Service Mesh.
- Automate the deployment of Event Processor Service within the GKE cluster.
- Integrate mTLS configuration for secure communication between services.

## 4. Data Storage and Analytics
- Define and deploy Terraform configurations for BigQuery tables across zones and regions.
- Establish connections between services and BigQuery.

## 5. Additional Services in GKE
- Create Terraform modules for deploying Tracking, Extract, and Notification Services in GKE clusters.
- Choose and implement Terraform configurations for the selected notification mechanism (Firebase or Cloud Pub/Sub).

## 6. Multi-Cluster Gateway Controller
- Evaluate and implement Istio's Ingress Gateway using Terraform configurations.
- Define and apply routing rules for seamless service discovery and load balancing across clusters.

## 7. Ingress Control
- Develop Terraform scripts for creating Ingress objects in Kubernetes for external access control.
- Specify and apply routing rules within the Ingress configurations.

## 8. Monitoring and Intrusion Detection
- Implement Terraform configurations for creating an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) instance.
- Configure logging and monitoring settings using Google Cloud Monitoring.

## 9. High Availability (HA)
- Design Terraform configurations to ensure workloads are distributed across zones and regions.
- Test and validate Terraform-managed failover mechanisms.

## 10. Documentation and Training
- Document Terraform modules, variables, and configurations.
- Provide training for the operations team on Terraform-based infrastructure management.

## 11. Testing
- Conduct Terraform-driven tests for the entire architecture.
- Perform security testing and validation using Terraform.

## 12. Deployment and Rollout
- Plan and execute phased deployment using Terraform configurations.
- Monitor performance during the initial rollout, adjusting Terraform scripts as needed.

## 13. Scaling and Optimization
- Implement Terraform configurations for auto-scaling mechanisms.
- Optimize resource allocation and utilisation using Terraform.

## 14. Backup and Recovery
- Develop Terraform configurations for regular backups of critical data.
- Implement Terraform scripts for recovery procedures and conduct drills.

## 15. Documentation Review and Update
- Regularly review and update Terraform documentation based on changes and improvements.
